# Markov Model based Chatbot
### Hannah Kerr

Chat bots are some of the most exciting and innovating applications of natural language processing
and machine learning algorithms. Chat bots are computer programs that simulate and conduct
human conversation. These programs have many uses and applications. Task based chat bots are
intended to assist the user in completing a specific task or objective. Some common examples are
bots that help users search for restaurants and hotels, make reservations for the user or answer
questions a user might have. These implementation of these bots are primarily rule based and
use pattern recognition and matching to converse with the user and complete the assigned task.
Task-based chat bots typically have a limited scope of conversational abilities and struggle with
any conversation outside of this scope.

Conversational chat bots differ from task based bots because their purpose is to recreate or
mimic human intelligence and allow the user to have a full and realistic conversation with the
bot. These chat bots typically involve more complicated natural language processing and machine
learning algorithms. This report covers the creation and implementation of a basic conversational
chat bot.

The result of this project is BotBuddy, a Markov Model based conversational chat bot. BotBuddy is trained on the Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus and uses Hidden Markov Model chains and
other methodology to generate responses based on user input. Additionally, BotBuddy utilizes
some regular expression pattern matching for further functionality, such as greetings, goodbyes, and
knock knock jokes.
